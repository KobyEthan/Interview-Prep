// Stack Memory: 
// The amount of memory allocated for each individual program. A fixed memory space.


// Heap Memory:
// It is a pile of memory space available to allocate and de-allocate. A dynamic memory space.

// Key Differences Between Stack and Heap Allocations:
 
// In a stack, the allocation and de-allocation are automatically done by the compiler whereas, in heap, it needs to be done by the programmer manually.
// Handling the Heap frame is costlier than handling the stack frame.
// Memory shortage problem is more likely to happen in stack whereas the main issue in heap memory is fragmentation.
// Stack frame access is easier than the heap frame as the stack has a small region of memory and is cache-friendly but in the case of heap frames which are dispersed throughout the memory so it causes more cache misses.
// A stack is not flexible, the memory size allotted cannot be changed whereas a heap is flexible, and the allotted memory can be altered.
// Accessing the time of heap takes is more than a stack.
